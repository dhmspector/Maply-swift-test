A very literal port of the Obj-C version of the WhirlyGlobe-Maply
tutorials to Swift (Xcode6.3.2 and Swift 1.2).

This version shows an issue with the CartoDBLayer tutorial where Swift
doesnt like MaplyPagingDelegate's required int properties; this is
referenced in https://github.com/mousebird/WhirlyGlobe/issues/326
